## üí° Tips

During the evaluation process, we value the importance of:
- **Clean coding** consistent indentation, class, ID naming conventions and code organization.
- **Semantic structure** HTML tags, such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, to provide a clear and meaningful structure to the content.
- **Responsiveness** layout adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Accessibility principles** content is accessible to all users.
- **SEO best practices** appropriate tags, alt attributes for images, others.
- **‚ùó Differentiating factor** will evaluate the candidates based on their `ability to deliver` the solution promptly while ensuring the highest level of quality.


## üèÜ Guidelines

We would like to reinforce some additional guidelines for evaluating your code during the selection process:

- The use of external packages is `not allowed`. All development should be done natively, using HTML and CSS, without the need for JavaScript, unless specifically requested.
- If icons are required, we recommend using vectors as `svg`.
- It is important to note that all code should be functional `offline`, ensuring that the pages are accessible and executable without relying on an internet connection.
- Regarding fonts, you may reference [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com).
- The `content` is available in the file [data.json](assets/data.json).
- Necessary `images` for coding are located in the [/assets](assets) folder.
